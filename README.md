# Bisq X: Bisq Research and Experimentation

## Introduction

Welcome. This repository is a proof of concept and prototyping environment for improvements to Bisq not well-suited to the typical pull request model. It's a place to come to consensus on potentially big and high-impact changes through working code before committing to implement those changes in production Bisq repositories.

The sections below are stubs for now but will come to include detailed information on:

- our [current goals](#current-goals) and why we have them;
- our [current efforts](#current-efforts) to realize those goals;
- the [help we need](#help-wanted) to implement those efforts;
- the [repo structure](#repo-structure) and code for each effort;
- how to [get started](#get-started) working with that code;
- and [next steps](#next-steps) for getting involved.

## Current Goals

### 1. Empower existing users to onboard friends and family to Bisq with a new and extraordinarily simple mobile trading experience

### 2. Facilitate delivering on Bisq's ambitious roadmap by growing the number of highly-skilled developers dedicated to working on it

## Current Efforts

### 1. Bisq Mobile

### 2. Bisq REST API and SDKs

### 3. Bisq Daemon and Bisq CLI Terminal Client

### 4. Bisq DCA and Market Maker demo apps

### 5. Demo presentation(s) showcasing the above
